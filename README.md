<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the project

This project aims, mainly, on making a multi Window Manager portable library to implement a single solution for the different GUI that I use from time to time in my system. As a secondary objective, with time, I want to make it more portable for any user that come across the same problems that I did/do.
